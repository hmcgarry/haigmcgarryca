    "Comment": "The Name of the Rose is a masterpiece of a modern novel. Umberto Eco's debut fictional work manages to encapsulate much of his nonfiction writing into an intriguing mystery which brings into question the nature of knowledge and how power hoards and censors it. More than that, it ties in themes of knowledge versus the belief of knowing, interpretation and misinterpretation, and reading the world around you like a book. I could not recommend this novel more."

    "Comment": "Umberto Eco outdoes his debut novel with Foucaul't Pendulum, a thriller mystery about a conspiracy that spans much of the space and time of Western civilization. This book, despite being set in a different time and place than The Name of the Rose, shares many similar themes to Eco's debut novel. The protagonist, Casaubon, has his life consumed by a Templar conspiracy that puts him on a fool's quest for the truth. A poignant work on the allure and nonsensicality of paranoid conspiracy, which has the structuring of the novel mirror the fragmented nature of 'The Plan' which the main cast of characters spend too much of their lives attempting to piece together. Rosy Crosses and Hermeticism, this book has it all."

    "Comment": "One thing I admire most about this novel is how well Kafka is capable of making the reader pity Gregor Samsa. Many people, in my experience, fixate on the 'Kafkaesque' quality of Kakfa's writings; that is a combination of the bizarre with the mundane, but what sets this novel apart from other works by Kafka is how truly pathetic Samsa is made out to be. Secondary texts describe this aspect as being autobiographical, how its revealing of Kafka's own self-perception around his family. How Samsa's only value to his family is in his ability to work, to provide money, and once that goes he's locked away. Beaten and scorned, he lives out the rest of his days in his bedroom, loathed and feared by those he loves."
